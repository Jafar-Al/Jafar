      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is an Artificial Intelligence system designed to detect lung cancer by analyzing chest X-ray images.
        We trained our custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from scratch using a dataset of 112,000 images provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
        All code, from training to deployment, was developed entirely by our team in Python.
        Initially, we created a basic interface using Python's Tkinter library, and later developed a full-featured web application interface.
        We used TensorFlow as our main deep learning library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> This system does not replace doctors — it is a tool to assist them in making more accurate diagnoses.
      </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The system receives a chest X-ray image as input.</li>
        <li>The image is processed by a CNN model trained to recognize patterns associated with lung cancer.</li>
        <li>The model outputs a prediction with a high level of accuracy.</li>
        <li>The result is displayed to the user through an easy-to-use web interface.</li>
        <li>The system is designed to assist medical professionals in making faster and more reliable diagnoses.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast:</strong> Provides results in just a few seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Achieved high accuracy during testing and validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Assists Doctors:</strong> Helps reduce human error by acting as a second opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Simple web interface suitable for clinical use.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Can be adapted to work with other types of medical imaging in the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI for Lung Disease Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to lung cancer detection, our system is also capable of diagnosing a variety of other lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis using advanced deep learning techniques.
        The AI model analyzes chest X-ray images and identifies disease-specific patterns that may not be immediately visible to the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        By expanding the scope of the system, we aim to provide a more comprehensive diagnostic tool that can support doctors in identifying multiple pulmonary conditions efficiently and accurately.
