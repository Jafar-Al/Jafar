    <h2>What Is Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Cancer is a disease where certain cells in the body begin to grow and divide uncontrollably.
      These abnormal cells don’t die when they should, and they can invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body through the blood or lymph systems.
      This uncontrolled growth disrupts how normal organs work and can be life-threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to me carefully—cancer is not a myth, and it doesn’t wait for anyone. It’s real, and it can grow silently.
      The earlier you understand that, the better you can protect yourself and the people you love. You, yes you.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>What Is Lung Cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Lung cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the lungs—usually in the cells lining the airways.
      It is one of the most dangerous types of cancer in the world.
      In fact, according to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally.
      This cancer can grow silently for years, often without clear symptoms, and by the time it is found, it may have already spread to other organs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t take this lightly. This isn’t just any illness. Lung cancer is deadly—but it becomes weaker when you act early.
      So act. Not just for you—for your family, your friends, your people. You.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-section">
    <h2>What Are the Signs of Lung Cancer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Unexplained weight loss,</li>
      <li>Constant fever or high body temperature,</li>
      <li>Excessive night sweating,</li>
      <li>Persistent cough or chest pain,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These signs can be easy to ignore—but they shouldn’t be.
      If you notice any of these symptoms, or even all of them, go see a doctor immediately.
      This is your body talking. Don’t ignore it. Don’t wait. Act now—you, and take everyone you care about with you.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-section">
    <h2>The Importance of Early Detection</h2>
    <p>
      Early detection of lung cancer means finding it before it has spread or caused major damage.
      When caught early, lung cancer can sometimes be treated more effectively—and even cured in some cases.
      Tools like chest X-rays, CT scans, and now artificial intelligence help detect it faster and more accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early detection is the strongest peaceful weapon we have against cancer.
      It’s not just about you going to get checked—it’s about bringing your loved ones, your family,
      your daughters, your friends, your people. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Move now—you.
